\chapter{Conclusion}

In the autonomous flight chapter autonomous flight on the Iris+ drone was explored using the APM Planner 2.0. It was discovered that developing and uploading a path to the drone was pretty straight forward.\\

Using a custom build path generator it was possible to design and upload custom designed search patterns to the drone via mavros. This gives the possibility of easily generating and launching a drone without any knowledge of drone flight if integrated into a GUI application.\\

During the tests it was found that security and pre flight checks are crucial in autonomous drone flight as a lot of unpredictable elements are involved. The tests also showed the excellent capabilities a relatively cheap drones has in following a path with no obstacles even in windy conditions.\\
