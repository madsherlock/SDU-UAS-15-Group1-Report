This report provides an solution to ease patrolling coasts,
 crowded areas such as beaches or even at sea by
 introducing a autonomously flying drone with
 video feed and vision processing capabilities.
This enables the coast guard/life guard to specify
 an area of interest on a graphical user interface, 
of which the drone can patrol. Already implemented 
solutions have proved successful and the demand for
 drone applications is increasing.\\ 
The work has been focused on creating a guide to
 setup a specific multirotor drone (3DR Iris+) for
 flight, along with algorithms to create search patterns
 based on known operating methods for life rescue at sea
 and vision-based software implemented on a camera system 
(GoPro Hero 3+ with a Tarot Gimbal) in order to launch the drone for autonomous flight, given the set parameters for search area, and detect human 
beings in water by postprocessing images on a computer. 
The results of this project have shown it
 to be feasible to use a retail system with customized 
software to assist in an emergency situation or as an aid in patrolling crowded beaches.  
Further work will focus on implementing hardware to enable online image processing, a fast connection to transmit data to a ground station and a customized graphical user interface based on Mavros.
