This paper describes a solution to the problem of coast patrolling and overseas searches
using an Unmanned Aerial System (UAS, drone) in the form of a quadrotor
flying autonomously with video feed and vision processing capabilities.
The aim is to enable the coast guard or life guard to specify
an area of interest on a user-friendly graphical user interface, similar to Google Earth,
for the drone to patrol.
Already implemented solutions have proven succesful
and the demand for drone applications is increasing.\\
This work is focused on the creation of a guide to setting up
a specific multirotor drone, the 3DR Iris+, for autonomous flight
along custom paths. Focus is also laid on the path generation,
for overseas search and rescue missions using flight search patterns
and vision-based software utilizing a camera system
(GoPro Hero 3 camera mounted on a Tarot Gimbal).
The drone should be able to autonomously follow
search pattern paths generated by user-specifiable parameters,
and be able to detect humans in water.
The implementation in this project is not online, the image postprocessing
takes place on a computer. It is assumed that the software running
offline on the computer can be extrapolated to an online implementation
on the drone.
The results of this project show the steps necessary
to make the drone fly autonomously and to connect through it
both through a graphical user interface named APMPlanner 2.0 and through
a ROS package named Mavros.
It is shown that automatized and parametrized search pattern based flight
path generation is possible through a developed C++ library for waypoint
manipulation and file format conversions, and Matlab scripts for search pattern generation.
Also shown are the results of an implementation of a human detection algorithm
which is able to detect humans in water and to distinguish them from other objects or living beings.
It is concluded that this work facilitates the UAS-based coast and overseas patrol system.

Further work will focus on implementing hardware to enable online image processing,
a fast connection to transmit data to a ground station and a customized
application with a graphical user interface utilizing Mavros.
