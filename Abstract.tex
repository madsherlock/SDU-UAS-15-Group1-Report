This paper describes a solution to the problem of coast and sea patrolling
using a quadrotor UAS
flying autonomously with video feed and processing capabilities.
The aim is to enable the user to specify
areas of interest for the drone to patrol, on a graphical user interface (GUI).
Already implemented solutions have proven successful
and the demand for drone applications is increasing.\\
This work focuses on the creation of a guide to setting up
a 3DR Iris+ multirotor for autonomous flight
along custom paths. Focus is also laid on the path generation
for search and rescue missions at sea using search patterns
and vision-based software utilizing a camera system
(GoPro and Tarot Gimbal).
The drone should be able to autonomously follow
search pattern paths generated by user-specifiable parameters,
and be able to detect humans in water.
The implementation in this project is not online, the image postprocessing
takes place on a computer. It is assumed that the software running
offline on the computer can be extrapolated to an online implementation
on the drone.
The results of this project show the steps necessary
to make the drone fly autonomously and to connect to it
through a ROS package named Mavros.
It is shown that automated and parametrized search pattern based
path generation is possible through a developed C++ library for waypoint
manipulation and Matlab scripts for search pattern generation.
Also shown are the results of an implementation of a human detection algorithm
which is able to detect humans in water and to distinguish them from other objects or living beings.
It is concluded that this work facilitates the UAS-based coast and patrol system at seas.

Further work will focus on enabling online image processing,
a fast data connection to a ground station and a customized
application with a GUI utilizing Mavros.
