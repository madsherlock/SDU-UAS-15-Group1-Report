# SDU-UAS-15-Group1-Report
Typeset Main.tex
Please don't upload typesetting files (with extensions such as .aux, .log or .pdf).

For those new to Git:
Clone this repository to a folder on your computer.

Every time you feel like writing on the report:
Pull the latest changes.
Edit files like crazy. Remember line breaks (press ENTER often)!
Commit your changes every now and then (like every 20 minutes or so).
Pull the latest changes again, and merge files.
If there are merge conflicts, git will tell you where they are and allow you to resolve them by editing the appropriate files.
Check that Main.tex will still typeset and that you haven't broken the universe.
Commit the merge.
Push your changes to git.

Notes:
REMEMBER LINE BREAKS! The more lines in your .tex files, the easier it is for git to auto-merge our work!
Small commits are easier to revert.
Mikael uses pdfLaTeX+MakeIndex+BibTeX for typesetting the document.
